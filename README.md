# Power-Visualizations

#### Hey, welcome back, here you will find all the data visualizations and stories i have created, they are mainly done in Power BI but you might find one or two on tableau, 

Personally i'm a huge fan of clean designs, but, as you know that depends on your audience, come take a look

To check my visuals --->[Power Dashboards](https://app.powerbi.com/groups/ef56e4a5-052f-4974-9bba-4e32a7bd5659/list)

I like to follow the guidelines from the book StoryTelling With Data, it's REALLY good, clean, simple and easy to follow, you can get it here---> [Storytelling](https://www.storytellingwithdata.com/)
